        <h1>ABOUT MY SELF?</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Jesus P. Napao but you can call me JES instead. I am currently a Senior High School student <br/>here at OLOPSC(Our Lady Of Perpetual Succor College) here in Marikina City, our school is private and is located in Conception Uno.</br> My life as a Senior High School student is kinda hard, the amount of school works are massive and the lessons are very hard. But what<br/> makes Senior High School interesting? The answer is,the knowledge that the teachers share to us, bond between students and<br/> teachers, bonds between student that will end up to being friends and also sharing ideas and knowledge between the students.<br/> Ofcourse there are also ups and downs, getting low remarks on exams or quiz, having misunderstanding with friends.<br/> Senior High School is full of exitement and knowledge that you'll wish the fun will  never end, all in all i enjoy my Senior High School<br/>life especially right now that i have good friends and a very great teachers. </p>
